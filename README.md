# Introduction

**The Cycle of Adaptive Progress** is a multidisciplinary framework designed to address the need for flexible, iterative decision-making in complex environments. By integrating insights from diverse fields—such as quality control, systems thinking, and decision sciences—this cycle supports continuous improvement and adaptability, making it universally applicable across domains. The process offers a structured yet flexible four-step cycle: **Observation, Deliberate Reflection, Decision-Making, and Implementation**.

- **Observation** establishes a comprehensive understanding of the current environment, gathering essential data and insights. This stage is foundational in fields like ecology, where monitoring environmental systems is critical, and in business, where observing market trends informs strategic decisions.

- **Deliberate Reflection** allows for analysis of observed data, recognizing patterns, risks, and opportunities. This phase mirrors practices in project management, where lessons learned are assessed, and in historical research, where past events are examined to inform current understanding.

- **Decision-Making** transforms insights from reflection into strategic choices, guiding action toward desired outcomes. This step is central in fields like medicine, where treatment decisions are made based on patient data, and in engineering, where design choices are informed by safety and efficiency standards.

- **Implementation** executes the chosen decision, applying it to the environment while remaining responsive to real-time feedback. Fields like software development, which use iterative methods, and adaptive management in environmental conservation illustrate how implementation must be adaptable, allowing adjustments as new data emerges.

As each cycle completes, the process naturally loops back to **Observation**, allowing for ongoing adaptation and responsiveness. This continuous cycle makes **The Cycle of Adaptive Progress** a universal model for tackling dynamic challenges in any field, empowering interdisciplinary teams to innovate and improve collaboratively.

## Purpose
This repository hosts the development of “The Cycle of Adaptive Progress” academic paper, following an open, version-controlled approach that allows for continuous refinement and feedback. It aims to bridge disciplinary divides, offering a shared process for tackling dynamic challenges.

## Versioning

This paper follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) principles to ensure transparent, incremental updates as revisions are made when new information comes to light. Version control enables a truly adaptive approach, allowing the Cycle of Adaptive Progress to develop and respond to feedback continuously. We use three levels of version updates:

- **Major Versions (X.0.0)**: Substantial changes to content, conclusions, or methodology.
- **Minor Versions (0.Y.0)**: Moderate updates, such as adding new references or expanding sections.
- **Patch Versions (0.0.Z)**: Minor corrections or formatting adjustments.

For details on how we apply Semantic Versioning to academic papers, see the [Versioning Academic Guide](supporting_documents/VERSIONING_ACADEMIC_PAPERS.md).

You can view all versions by exploring the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/mittons/TheCycleOfAdaptiveProgress/tags), and major releases will include notes summarizing significant changes.
